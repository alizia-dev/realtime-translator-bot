**startup idea:**

- To translate live conversations on calls/meetings, your system will need to handle:

**1. Audio Capture**

- From Teams, Zoom, Google Meet, etc.

- Either by integrating with their SDKs/APIs or by joining as a bot participant (e.g., your service joins the meeting as a “listener”).

**2. Speech-to-Text (STT)**

- Convert audio to text in real time.

- Options: OpenAI Whisper (open source, highly accurate), Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Cognitive Services, AWS Transcribe.

**3. Translation**

- Translate the transcript into target languages.

- Options: OpenAI GPT models, Google Translate API, DeepL API, Azure Translator.

**4. Text-to-Speech (TTS) (Optional)**

- If you want the translated voice back into the meeting.

- Options: Azure Neural TTS, Amazon Polly, ElevenLabs.

**5. Integration / Delivery**

- Show captions in real time on screen.

- Or deliver as subtitles in meeting UI (some APIs support custom captions).

- Or output as audio (bot voice speaking translation live).
